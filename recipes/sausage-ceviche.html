    <h2>Coconut Red Curry With Tofu</h2>
    <p>This simple weeknight red curry relies on jarred or canned red curry paste for flavor, which you can find at larger supermarkets and specialty markets. Transfer leftover canned curry paste to a jar, top it with a little oil and store in the refrigerator for up to a month. Or freeze for longer storage. Feel free to substitute other vegetables for the mushrooms and snow peas, though you might have to increase the cooking time slightly if using something dense like carrot or cubed winter squash.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>TOFU AND CAULIFLOWER</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 small head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-sized florets (1 small head yields ~3-4 cups or 340 g // can also use 1/2 of a large cauliflower)</li>
        <li>1 (14 oz.) package extra-firm tofu, torn into 1-inch pieces</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>TOFU AND CAULIFLOWER: Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place the bite-sized cauliflower florets and 1-inch pieces of tofu onto the baking sheet. Drizzle with oil then sprinkle with curry powder and salt. Toss to thoroughly coat. Bake for 20-25 minutes, tossing halfway through. The cauliflower will be tender and golden brown on the outside and the tofu slightly crispy.</li>

    </ol>
